```

```
npm install -g knex
```

Run the database migrations:

```
knex migrate:latest

Run the database seeds if you want to see some fake data or run the tests:

```
knex seed:run
```

## Commands

Start the server with a single command:

```
npm run start
```

Transpile all the ES6/ES2015 client-side JavaScript for browsers
